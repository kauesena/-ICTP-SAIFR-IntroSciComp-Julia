# ICTP-SAIFR/Serrapilheira — Introduction to Scientific Computing (Julia) - 2022

This is the version written in Julia of the repository -------, which is written in R. This is the demo project developed during the classes of the course Introduction to Scientific Programming of the Serrapilheira/ICTP-SAIFR Training Program in Quantitative Biology and Ecology (to which the organisers referred as Computational Methods [a bit confusingly]). Here the code shall be in R.

The first part of the class is being taught by Sara Mortara. The second part will be taught by Andrea Sánchez-Tapia. Perhaps their parts and Ricardo Cerri part are collectively referred to as _Computational Methods_ but only Sara and Andrea are articulated. Who knows?
